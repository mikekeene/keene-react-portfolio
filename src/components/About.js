                    My name is Michael Keene and I'm from San Antonio, TX.
                    <br />
                    I'm a H-E-B partner in warehousing and love it. 
                    I'm also currently a student at UTSA's coding bootcamp.
                    <br />
                    I have a lot of interests but but my passions are spending time with 
                    my family, reading or watching a good movie, and I enjoy playing video games
